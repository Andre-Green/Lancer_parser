# Lancer_parser
## Simple parser of [auto.ria](https://auto.ria.com/uk/) for Lancer IX

The parser can create the EXCEL file with the main attributes of lancer XI cars.
It can iterate from page to page with a `sleep` time.

First you need to enter a lower price, then a maximum price. After a while, an EXCEL file will be created.

It can be easily changed to another car search. You need to change the link in a 21 line of code for this act.
